          <h2>
            Browse Solutions - Capabilities
          </h2>

          <h4>All but one of the Capabilities have been pre-defined, you can read more about them here <a href="">[link]</a>.</h4>

          <p>The scope of a Catalogue Solution is described using Capabilities. A Catalogue Solution may have just one Capability, or it may have a group of Capabilities.</p>

          <p>There are some key terms you need to understanding when using the Buying Catalogue:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Catalogue Solution = a product or service on the Buying Catalogue.</li>
            <li>Capabilities = express a business need, for example, 'Recording Consultations' describes the need for General Practice staff to be able to make a digital record of any consultation with a patient.</li>
            <li>Epics = the functions that make up the Capability, for example, under ‘Recording Consultations’ the Epics are: ‘record Consultation information’ and ‘manage Consultation form templates’. There are two types of Epic – Must Epics which must be met, and May Epics which are optional</li>
            <li>Acceptance Criteria = describe the requirements of an Epic and are used to assess whether an Epic has been met</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Each Capability has a title, description, Epics and Acceptance Criteria. Each Capability can have a number of Epics. For some Capabilities, a Catalogue Solution must meet the Acceptance Criteria for all the Must Epics, and for others, they only need to meet the Acceptance Criteria of at least one Must Epic. The Buying Catalogue will show you which Epics have been assessed as being met, so you will be able to understand the differences between Catalogue Solutions.</p>

          <p>There are six Foundation Capabilities. These Capabilities are a subset of the Capabilities mandated in the NHS England GPIT Operating Model. On the Buying Catalogue, a Catalogue Solution or Solutions that combine to fulfil the Foundation Capabilities is known as a Catalogue Foundation Solution Set. For practices, the GMS funding must be used to purchase the Foundation Capabilities first, and if you have funds remaining, you can use that to buy further Catalogue Solutions providing the other Capabilities. You can also purchase a Solution with your own funds.</p>

          <p>You can search for Catalogue Solutions by choosing to either search for Catalogue Foundation Solution Sets, or you can identify your needs, map them to one or more Capabilities, and search for Catalogue Solutions using the Capabilities.</p>
